# MyOnly.Cloud API

This is a work in progress, currantly in the alfa stage. We recommend not to use it in any purposes except as an early technology preview.

The MyOnly.Cloud service is high grade secure private data storage based
on enforced and complete end-to-end encryption. 

Apart the client data safety, this cloud provides verioned storage, head and body separation and public handles that allow to anyone with a handle (but not the cloud!) access encrypted data using a plain URL. 

Handles works somewhat like our widely used [crypstie](https://crypstie.com) service, by securing key to decipher data in the URI fragment (part after the `#` in the URI) that is never sent to the server but processed completely at the client. 

Some information could be found in [autogenerated docs](https://kb.universablockchain.com/system/static/myonlycloud_js/index.html).
