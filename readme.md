# MyOnly.Cloud API

> public beta since v0.2.13


The MyOnly.Cloud service is a truly private data storage implementing
enforced and complete end-to-end encryption solutions based on [parsec protocol](https://kb.universablockchain.com/parsec_1_specifications/303) which is immune to dns and tls/ssl attacks including certificate re-emission. 

Apart the client data safety, this cloud provides versioned storage, head and body separation and public handles that allow to anyone with a handle (but not the cloud!) access encrypted data using a plain URL. Using _handles_. 

Handles are direct links that work somewhat like our widely used [crypstie](https://crypstie.com) service, by securing key to decipher data in the URI fragment (part after the `#` in the URI) that is never sent to the server but processed completely at the client. 

Some information could be found in [autogenerated docs](https://kb.universablockchain.com/system/static/myonlycloud_js/index.html).
